            I'm a Catalan software and data engineer born in the mid 80s, and as many people from my generation,
            I feel like I was in the transition between two very different epochs: the analogical and the digital.
            Some authors call us "Xenials", in the middle of "X" and "Millenials", living in an analogical world
            as kids, and in a digital world as teenagers. And I perfectly match this description, I played with
            marbles and spinning tops in the streets of my neighborhood with other kids, and later I had Internet
            connection, got addicted to the IRC and created geocities web pages with "blink" tags and animated GIFs.
            <br><br>
            My first contact with programming was with Logo and Basic, and I guess my predilection for REPLs comes
            from it. Then it came C and Assembler when I was in the high school, and that made me love the low level.
            I learned <i>many</i> other programming languages during my career, but one cought my eye in recent
            times (2021), and is the one I use the most for my personal projects: <b>Rust</b>.
            <br><br>
            I'm currently working at New Relic as a data engineer, and I've been doing telemetry since 2014. But data
            is not the only thing I did in my career. I did mobile apps for almost a decade (iOS, Android and Web),
            I worked in video players and media players, I worked writing and modifying device drivers for the Linux
            kernel, and even I did some electronics (I have a BS in Electronic Engineering).

            Proud husband and father of two wonderful girls, in my spare time (the little I have) I love spending
            time with my family: traveling, in the nature or in cultural activities. My profession is also my hobby,
            so I spend a good amount of spare time programming, mainly at night, when the girls are sweetly sleeping.
            And finally, one of my preferred solo activities is paragliding. It blends my passion for nature, sport,
            fantastic views and a bit of adrenaline.
