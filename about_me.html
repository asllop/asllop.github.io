            I'm a Catalan software and data engineer born in the mid 80s, and as many people from my generation, I feel like I was in the transition betwen two very different epochs: the analogical and the digital.
            Some authors call us "Xenials", between "X" and "Millenials", living in an analogical world as kids, and in a digital world as teenagers.
